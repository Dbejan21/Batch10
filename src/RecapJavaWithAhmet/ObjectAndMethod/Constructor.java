    //Possible Interview Question:
    //1)What is constructor and what do you do with it?
    //2)Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?
    //3) can you make the constructor private?

    /*
    explanation suggestion: GO FROM GENERAL TO DEEP

    CONSTRUCTOR is a way of initiliazing instance variables. We have specific
    features for the constructor like:
    *)it must have same name of the class
    *)it doesnt have return type
    ---> AGAIN WE NEED IT TO INITILIAZE our instance variable

    CONSTRUCTOR AND METHOD:
    DIFFERENCES:
    Method has return type
   Methods may or may not have same(class) or different reference name

   3)PRIVATE --> YOU CAN MAKE IT for the singleton pattern design(it is a special
   class that do not let you create an object.
