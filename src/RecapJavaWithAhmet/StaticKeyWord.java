    //POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    //1)What is static KEYWORD
    //2)what is static BLOCK
    //3)what is static variable

    //1)static Keyword: is a keyword to make the methods..etc belongs to the class
    //****) the advantage of having static keyword is that you do not need to create
    //and object to access the variables or methods.
    //***the disadvantage of having static keyword is that you cannot override the
    //methods once you call it.

    //2)STATIC BLOCK: is the block that can be called once(1 time it works), it always
    //executed the first.

    //3)STATIC VARIABLE : it makes the variables belongs to the class.
                        //**It is shareable(changeable)-->common for each object.
                        //*it can be accessed by other classes without creating an object.
