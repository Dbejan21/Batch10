    //Possible Interview Question:

    //1)what is the difference between final, finalize, FINALLY
    //2)How do you handle the exceptions?
    //3)What is the difference between error and exception

    //1) final: is the KEYWORD to make your variables,classes and methods final
    //2) finalize: is a METHOD to see system gc is working ar not.
    //3)finally:is a BLOCK that comes after try and catch.

    //2) THROWS--> after the method signature  and TRY AND CATCH inside of the block

    //3) ERROR: YOU CANNOT HANDLE THE ERROR<>
    // EXCEPTION ---> YOU CAN HANDLE IT>>
